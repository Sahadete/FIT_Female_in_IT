<h1 class="header1">The history of the <span id="fit">FIT</span> project</h1>
<p class="historia">A study on women active in the ICT sector, published by DG CONNECT in October 2013, exposed that only 30% of the around 7 million people working in the 
information and communication (ICT) sector are women.</p>
<p class="historia">They are under-represented at all levels in the ICT sector, especially in decision-making positions. Further, the EC's Women active in the ICT sector report 
found that of every 1,000 women in the EU with a degree, only 29 have a specialization in ICT, compared with 95 for men, and only four in 1,000 will work in the
 ICT sector.</p>
 
 <p class="historia">According to the Skill Gap Analyses conducted by the Association of ICT companies of Kosovo (STIKK) and supported by EYE Project, only 20% of people employed 
 in the sector are women. This is far below even what is currently considered bellow in EU.</p>

 <p class="historia">Some of the factors that may prevent women’s involvement in the ICT sector in Kosovo are the cultural stereotypes, internal barriers, lack of financial means, 
 access to education, etc. With the ICT sector developing day by day, and increasing demand for human resource capacity, there is a lot of space for improvement 
 in female’s involvement in the ICT sector, and especially youth that are on the process of choosing their career paths. A.U.K.- Training and Development 
 Institute in collaboration with EYE project are implementing a project that will improve the current situation by offering trainings and certifications at 
 the A.U.K.-Training and Development institute.</p>
